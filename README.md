# DynamicMapSpellbook

**DynamicMapSpellbook** is a C library that makes dynamic maps much easier to use and manage. Instead of
raw pointers and manually keeping track of size, and allocating memory, this library does all of that for you,
and you can focus on the more important aspects of your program.
